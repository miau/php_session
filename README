PhpSession
==========

This plugin enable your Rails application to share session information
with PHP application.

With this plugin, session information created by PHP application can be
read/write by Rails application (at least primitive PHP types), and vice
versa.


Prerequisite
============

PHP sessions should be stored in a table on DBMS.  It is supposed that
the PHP application use Jon Parise's PostgreSQL Session Handler, type of
DBMS is not limited and table and fields' name could be customized.

  PostgreSQL Session Handler for PHP
  http://www.csh.rit.edu/~jon/projects/pgsql_session_handler/

The session table of PHP's environment is supposed to be below by default.

  CREATE TABLE php_sessions (
      session_id  CHAR(40)    NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
      last_active INTEGER     NOT NULL,
      data        TEXT
  );


Install
=======

You can install the plugin with the following command.

  $ cd <RAILS_ROOT>
  $ ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/miau/php_session


Usage
=====

If you have not created config/initializers/session_store.rb, create the
file at first.

  $ rake config/initializers/session_store.rb

And you use the acive record store, uncomment this line.

  #ActionController::Base.session_store = :active_record_store

You might change session key string if your rails application shares
session key with PHP application.

  ActionController::Base.session = {
    :key         => 'PHPSESSID',
  }

And you should set ActiveRecord::SessionStore.session_class;

  ActiveRecord::SessionStore.session_class = PhpSession

Unless the database of PHP session table is same as Rails' database
defined in config/database.yml, you should set PHPSession.connection.

  config = {
    :host     => "192.168.0.1",
    :port     => "5432",
    :username => "username",
    :password => "password",
    :database => "database",
  }
  PhpSession.connection = ActiveRecord::Base::postgresql_connection(config)
